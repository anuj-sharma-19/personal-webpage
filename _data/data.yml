    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently working as Lead Research Engineer in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at
      <u><a href="https://five.ai/"><span style="color: brown; ">FiveAI</span></a></u> in
      Scene Understanding Team where we are building large offline models to fuse multi-modality data 
      (cameras and lidar) for 3D object detection and tracking. The goal is to use these
      large models for offline perception and generation of automatic labels that could be used to train the online
      models. This work is published in <u><a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024W/WAD/papers/Gunn_Lift-Attend-Splat_Birds-eye-view_Camera-lidar_Fusion_using_Transformers_CVPRW_2024_paper.pdf"><span style="color: blue; ">CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD)</span></a></u>.

      I have also led a team on the extension of the fusion model to use temporal information from a sequence of multi-modal frames, which
      signifcantly improved the model's performance for 3D object detection.

      I am currently also working on diffusion models to inject 3D objects jointly in cameras and lidar.

      At FiveAI, my work has been primarily focussed on applying deep learning and computer vision techniques for 
      scene perception. In the past, I have extensively worked on 2D object detection and deployed it on FiveAI's
      autonomous driving car which played a significant role in the successful trials of Five's car on the streets
      of London in 2019. I have deployed several models for 2D and 3D detection on Five's platform for offline testing.
      
      I also have experience of utilizing unlabelled data to improve 3D object detection in lidar point cloud
      using semi-supervised methods.
      
      Prior to joining FiveAI, I visited the
      <u><a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/"><span style="color: brown; ">Torr Vision Group (University of Oxford)</span></a></u>
      for my Masters Thesis in 2017.

      Before my Masters, I worked at ADRDE, India (2009-2016) as a Research Scientist to design and build Lighter-Than-Air systems.
      My work focussed on dynamic modeling and control of aerial vehicles.

      I had also developed the attitude control algorithm of a nano-satellite during my Bachelors studies in Aerospace
      Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2005-2009). The satellite was successfully launched in 2011.
