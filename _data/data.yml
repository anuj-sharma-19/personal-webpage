    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Presently, I am working as a Member of Core Team, Member of Technical Staff in a Stealth AI Startup. I am building
      an application using LLMs and agentic AI.

      Previously, I worked at Mistral AI as a Research Engineer, and built tools to help speedup the research on Large
      Language Models.

      Earlier, I worked as Lead Research Engineer in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at
      <u><a href="https://five.ai/"><span style="color: brown; ">FiveAI</span></a></u>, an autonomous vehicle startup,
      acquired by <u><a href="https://www.bosch.com/"><span style="color: brown; ">Bosch</span></a></u> in 2022.

      I have worked on building algorithms using deep learning for multimodal scene perception, focusing on object detection and
      tracking, and have led several efforts on object detection in camera, lidar and radar and deployed models on FiveAI's
      autonomous car's self-driving software stack and online cloud platform for offline testing and auto-labelling.

      I have worked on multimodal (camera + lidar) data generation for 3D object inpainting using stable diffusion. This work is published in
      collaboration in CVPR 2025 Workshop.

      My (collaborative) work on multi-modality fusion for object detection using transformers got published at
      <u><a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024W/WAD/papers/Gunn_Lift-Attend-Splat_Birds-eye-view_Camera-lidar_Fusion_using_Transformers_CVPRW_2024_paper.pdf"><span style="color: blue; ">CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD)</span></a></u>,
      and I have also led the project to extend this fusion model to utilize temporal information over a sequence of frames for detection and tracking.

      Additionally, I have been a part of the
      <u><a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/"><span style="color: brown; ">Torr Vision Group, University of Oxford</span></a></u>
      for my Masters Thesis for a brief period in 2017.

#      Before my Masters, I worked at ADRDE, India (2009-2016) as a Research Scientist to design and build
#      Lighter-Than-Air systems. My work focussed on dynamic modeling and control of aerial vehicles.

#      I had also developed the attitude control algorithm of a nano-satellite during my Bachelors studies in Aerospace
#      Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2005-2009). The satellite was successfully launched in 2011.

#      I was responsible (component owner) for object detection stack on FiveAI's autonomous car self-driving software,
#      which played a significant role in the successful trials of FiveAI's car on the streets of London in 2019. I have
#      developed and deployed several models for 2D and 3D detection on FiveAI's online cloud platform for offline
#      testing and auto-labeling.

#      At FiveAI, I have worked on algorithms for scene perception, primarily focusing on object detection and tracking
#      in 2D and 3D, fusing multi-modality data using transformers, using temporal information and foundation models and
#      deployed the machine learning software on the autonomous car, and also on the online cloud platform at FiveAI.

#      I am currently working as Lead Research Engineer in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at
#      <u><a href="https://five.ai/"><span style="color: brown; ">FiveAI</span></a></u> in
#      Scene Understanding Team where we are building large offline models to fuse multi-modality data
#      (cameras and lidar) for 3D object detection and tracking. The goal is to use these
#      large models for offline perception and generation of automatic labels that could be used to train the online
#      models. This work is published in <u><a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024W/WAD/papers/Gunn_Lift-Attend-Splat_Birds-eye-view_Camera-lidar_Fusion_using_Transformers_CVPRW_2024_paper.pdf"><span style="color: blue; ">CVPR 2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD)</span></a></u>.

#      I have also led a team on the extension of the fusion model to use temporal information from a sequence of multi-modal frames, which
#      signifcantly improved the model's performance for 3D object detection.
#
#      Presently, I am working on diffusion models for multi-modality data generation to inject 3D objects jointly
#      in cameras and lidar.

##      At FiveAI, my work has been primarily focussed on applying deep learning and computer vision techniques for
##      scene perception. In the past, I have extensively worked on 2D object detection and deployed it on FiveAI's
##      autonomous driving car which played a significant role in the successful trials of Five's car on the streets
##      of London in 2019. I have deployed several models for 2D and 3D detection on Five's platform for offline testing.
#
##      I also have experience of utilizing unlabelled data to improve 3D object detection in lidar point cloud
##      using semi-supervised methods.
#
#      Prior to joining FiveAI, I visited the
#      <u><a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/"><span style="color: brown; ">Torr Vision Group (University of Oxford)</span></a></u>
