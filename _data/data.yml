    summary: |
      I am currently working as a Senior Research Engineer in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at
      <u><a href="https://five.ai/"><span style="color: brown; ">FiveAI</span></a></u>, where we are building the
      software to autonomously drive vehicles. Here, my work is primarily focussed on applying deep learning and
      computer vision techniques for scene perception on autonomous vehicles. Prior to joining FiveAI, I visited the
      <u><a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/"><span style="color: brown; ">Torr Vision Group (University of Oxford)</span></a></u>
